# Hotel-Revenue-Dashboard

Welcome to our Hotel Revenue Analysis project – where data meets hospitality in a quest for insights! Armed with the mighty duo of Power BI and SQL, I've embarked on a journey through a treasure trove of hotel revenue data, straight from the **Microsoft SQL Server**. My goal? Uncover hidden gems, answer burning questions, and sprinkle a bit of data magic on strategic recommendations.

The Scoop
In a nutshell, we wanted answers to these burning questions:

1. **Is our hotel revenue throwing a party and growing every year?**
Using the power of data analytics, I've charted the hotel's revenue trends over the years. The numbers don't lie—our revenue has been gradually increasing, showcasing a consistent upward trajectory! 🌟

2. **Should we give our parking a makeover and make it bigger?**
Wondering about parking space? I dove deep into the data, and the insights point towards a potential need for an expansion. The findings suggest that there is currently no need for a parking upgrade. 🚗💰

3. **What's the gossip in the data? Any trends sipping coffee in the corner?**
Beyond these insights, I've unearthed some intriguing trends hidden in the data. These trends are like gold nuggets, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making. 🧐

**Tools of the Trade**
Power BI: Picture this as our data artist, turning raw numbers into a visual masterpiece. It's like a magic wand for understanding revenue trends.

SQL: Our data detective! It digs through massive datasets, sniffs out the important bits, and serves them on a silver platter for analysis.

What makes this project even more special is that it's my very first attempt at creating a dashboard! The learning journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to continue honing my data analytics skills. 📊📚
