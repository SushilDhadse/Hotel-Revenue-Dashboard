# Hotel-Revenue-Dashboard

Welcome to our Hotel Revenue Analysis project â€“ where data meets hospitality in a quest for insights! Armed with the mighty duo of Power BI and SQL, we've embarked on a journey through a treasure trove of hotel revenue data, straight from the **Microsoft SQL Server**. Our goal? Uncover hidden gems, answer burning questions, and sprinkle a bit of data magic on strategic recommendations.

The Scoop
In a nutshell, we wanted answers to these burning questions:

1. Is our hotel revenue throwing a party and growing every year?
2. Should we give our parking a makeover and make it bigger?
3. What's the gossip in the data? Any trends sipping coffee in the corner?

**Tools of the Trade**
Power BI: Picture this as our data artist, turning raw numbers into a visual masterpiece. It's like a magic wand for understanding revenue trends.
SQL: Our data detective! It digs through massive datasets, sniffs out the important bits, and serves them on a silver platter for analysis.
